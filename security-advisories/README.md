# TYPO3 security advisories (structured data)

## Next steps

Having this list does not necessarily mean I'm doing all on my own...
Any helping hand is appreciated - just get in contatct with the TYPO3 security team or me directly.

* create JSON schema for advisories
* transform to RDF/OWL ontology for advisories (optional, but very nice to have)
* create TYPO3 extension that allows to render news/articles from these advisories (current all advisory news are handcrafted - basically this shall be changed)
* create vulnerability database at https://advisories.typo3.org/
  + overview of recent advisories
  + lots of filters (version, vulernability, metrics, components/names)
  + statistics & graphs (because it always looks good - and helps to visualize our mission)
  + ... build in some nice VueJS, Angular, Polymer/Lit, React application (personal preferences are in Polymer)
